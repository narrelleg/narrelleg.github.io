Welcome!  I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University. My research examines nation-building, prejudice reduction, and political violence, with a regional focus on sub-Saharan Africa. Particularly, I am interested in bottom-up approaches to reducing ethnic tensions and fostering national unity in conflict and post-conflict settings. My dissertation explores these topics in the context of Nigeria in the aftermath of the Biafran War. I have conducted fieldwork in Abuja and Lagos, Nigeria, and in Nairobi, Kenya.

Prior to Princeton, I received a M.A. from the University of Chicago's Committee on International Relations, and a B.A. from the University of Florida, with a focus on African studies. In my spare time, I sing in choirs.
