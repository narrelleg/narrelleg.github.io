Welcome!  I am a PhD student in the Department of Politics at Princeton University. My research examines nation-building, prejudice reduction, and political violence, with a regional focus on sub-Saharan Africa. Working at the intersection of political economy, comparative politics, and political psychology, I focus on bottom-up approaches to reducing ethnic tensions and fostering national unity in conflict and post-conflict settings.  One line of work examines the inter-generational transmission of attitudes developed during episodes of violence, and the role of narratives and history education in exacerbating or mitigating these historical legacies. Another investigates the use of national service programs for facilitating inter-group contact and socializing individuals into pluralistic forms of nationalism. My dissertation explores these topics in the context of Nigeria in the aftermath of the Biafran War. Methodologically, I utilize a combination of original surveys, field experiments, and qualitative interviews. I have conducted fieldwork in Abuja and Lagos, Nigeria, and in Nairobi, Kenya.

Prior to Princeton, I received a M.A. from the University of Chicago's Committee on International Relations, and a B.A. from the University of Florida, with a focus on African studies. In my spare time, I sing in choirs.
