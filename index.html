Welcome!  I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University. Broadly, my research examines prejudice reduction, ethnic politics, and peace-building in post-conflict settings, with a regional focus on sub-Saharan Africa. My dissertation explores the implications of (not) teaching about historical violence to schoolchildren in post-conflict countries, and examines the influence of historical narratives about past violence on modern-day inter-group prejudice and tension. My current research focuses primarily on the context of Nigeria in the aftermath of the Biafran War, and uses a mix of original surveys, qualitative interviews, and a field experiment. In the past, I have also conducted fieldwork in Nairobi, Kenya.

Prior to Princeton, I received a M.A. from the University of Chicago's Committee on International Relations, and a B.A. from the University of Florida, with a focus on African studies. In my spare time, I sing in choirs.
