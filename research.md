### Dissertation Project

*Forgive or Forget? History Education in Post-Conflict Countries*

In my dissertation, I examine the role of history education (or its lack) in shaping the long-term legacies of violent inter-group conflict. While history education is typically considered an important tool for shaping national identity and unity, many post-conflict countries instead attempt to suppress and erase their histories, leaving out all or large parts of their pasts from school curricula. My dissertation will answer several interrelated questions: Is it possible to use history education as a tool for peace-building and nation-building in contexts where the history being taught is contested and polarized? Or will attempts to teach about historical violence lead only to backlash? Can peace-building and post-conflict nation-building efforts succeed while suppressing rather than engaging with difficult aspects of the nation's past? Or will ignoring the past only allow tensions to fester? 

To answer these questions, I am pursuing two stages of data collection in Nigeria, where history has been inconsistently taught in schools in the 50 years since the nation's civil war. First, I conducted an inter-generational survey of 2584 current secondary school students and their parents across 1292 households in 3 Nigerian cities to determine what narratives about historical violence spread in the absence of formal education, through families and communities. Next, I am running a field experiment in Nigerian schools to determine whether introducing history and "peace" education about the civil war would be effective at reducing inter-group prejudice and support for violence, compared with alternative approaches to peace education which are more abstract and internationally focused. My work coincides with ongoing policy efforts in Nigeria to design peace and history education with support from UNESCO. In future work, I will expand my focus from Nigeria to other post-conflict cases which have taken various approaches to dealing with their contested histories in schools. 

### Other Projects

My other projects touch on various aspects of a larger research agenda, including 1) the long-term and micro-level effects of civil violence and 2) the role of inter-ethnic prejudice and distrust in politics.
